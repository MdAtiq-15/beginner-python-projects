Selects random colour for the user. User can keep on spinning as much as they want.
They can type 'stop' at anytime to end it.

Version Notes

Version 1.0:
    Very basic interactive colour picker for user. It selects random colour from a list for the user.
    What I learnt:
    Had to recall how to print all the list using '.join()' method and random number generator.
    It will now help me remember these better than tutorials.
