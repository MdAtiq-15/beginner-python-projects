Selects random colour for the user. User can keep on spinning as much as they want.
They can type 'stop' at anytime to end it.

DIFFICULTY - 2/4

Version Notes

Version 1.0:

    Very basic interactive colour picker for user. It selects random colour from a list for the user.

    What I learnt:
    Had to recall how to print all the list using '.join()' method and random number generator.
    It will now help me remember these better than tutorials.

Version 2.0:

    Added a counter to count the number of spins done and dictionary 'results' that store the colour(as key)
    and number of times(as a value) they were chosen

Version 2.1:

    Prints the result in decending order.

    What I learnt:
    I learnt about sorted() method to sort any iterable also the use of lamba function in python.
    I used AI for this not to complete my code but to teach me how to print a dictionary in
    decending order.
